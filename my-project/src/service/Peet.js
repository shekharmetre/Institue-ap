// This is a javascript class called PeerService that creates a new instance of the RTCpeerconneton class form the wertc api.the rtc peerconeecteion class is used to establish and manage peer-to-peer connection between browsers or devices for real-time communication.

// The peerservices class takes no arguments in its constructore,and it create a new rtcpeeronne tion istances with the follwoing configuration.
// ice servers: An array of ice servers that can be used for NAT traversal and relaying. in this case,the array includes two ice servers.
// /Decntrailizd networkd:P2p technology is used to create decentrailised networks, where there is no centeral authority controlling the flow of information. Example include blockchain networks and distributed hash tables.
// Video conferrencing:P2P video conferrince allows users to connect directly with each other,whitouth the need for a centreal server.
// gaminmg:p2p gaming allows players to connect directly with each other,without the need for a central server.
// social networks:p2p sockal networks allow users to connect directly with each other, without the need for a central server.
// IOt:p2p technolgoy is usedd in iot Devices to enabble devices to comunicate with each othere directly ,without the need for a central server.
// what is peer why use peer?
// ans: The code yor proviced is ajavascrip called peerservices.it appears to be service tha tmanages the connection between two peers(i.e. devices or applications) using the webrtc() protocol.
// THe peerservices class haa s a construct that initailizes a new rtcpeerconnecction object if one doesn to already exist then crea. Ice:servers property in the rtc peerconnectoin construct is used to sepcify the interactive connectivity establishment(ICE) servers that will be used to establish the conection. ICE is a protocol used to establish and maintain connection between devices or applications.
// in this code , the iceservers property is iset to an array of ice servers that include google stun servers and the twilo stun serversl these servers are used to help establish and maintain the connection betewen the peers.so the answer your question is peer in this context rerferst to the other device or application that is being connecied to using the peerservicrs class. THe peersevice class ise use to establish and managge the connection between the local device or application and the remote peer.
